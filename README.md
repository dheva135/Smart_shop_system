In supermarkets, product recognition for billing and stock management is la-bor-intensive and inefficient. To address these issues, a real-time product identification system using computer vision and deep learning is proposed. The smart shopping system improves consumer experience with automatic cart billing, reducing checkout time and stock update alerts. Custom dataset of retail products are used for training YOLOv8, with fixed multiple cameras to capture different views to identify hidden objects and objects of different scales using instance segmentation. Navigation system helps to provide a shortest path from the starting point to interested products. We achieve a maximum F1 score of 0.978 across all products with the least training time compared to other detection models.
